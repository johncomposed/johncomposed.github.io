<h2>Contributing</h2><p>We love contributions!</p>
<p><strong>Please base any merge request on the <em>development</em> branch instead of <em>master</em>.</strong></p>
<p>The reason for this is that we&#39;re trying to use
<a href="http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/">git flow</a>, and it makes merging your pull
request heck of a lot easier for us.</p>
<p>Please avoid including anything from the <code>dist/</code> directory as that can make merging harder, and we
always generate these files when we make a new release.</p>
<p>If its a new field type consider making it an add-on instead,
especially if it has external dependencies. See <a href="docs/extending.md">extending Schema Form documentation.</a></p>
<p>With new features we love to see updates to the docs as well as tests, that makes it super
easy and fast for us to merge it!</p>
<p>Also consider running any code through the code style checker <a href="https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs">jscs</a>
(or even better use it in your editor) with preset set to <code>google</code>. You can also us <code>gulp jscs</code> to
check your code.</p>
